<p>
  To do this, you will need to bring in approximately 
  {{as-currency annualProfitGoal round='2'}} in profit annually, 
  or {{as-currency monthlyProfitGoal round='2'}} per month.

<h2>Result</h2>

<p>

Based on these numbers, you'll bring in approximately {{as-currency totalProfit
round='2'}} over the next {{timespan}} months,

{{#if isShortOfGoal}}
    leaving you roughly {{as-currency displayDelta round='2'}} short of your goal.
{{else}}
    putting you roughly {{as-currency displayDelta round='2'}} over than your goal.
{{/if}}
</p>

{{#if isShortOfGoal}}
  <p>
    You've got a few options:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You could increase your price by {{as-currency priceDeltaToHitGoal round=true}} to {{as-currency priceToHitGoal round=true}}</li>
    {{#if growthIsPercent}}
      <li>You could increase your growth rate by {{as-percent growthRateDeltaToHitGoal round=true}} to {{as-percent growthRateToHitGoal round=true}}</li>
      <li>You could increase the number of customers you start out with by {{as-integer growthSeedDeltaToHitGoal}} to {{as-integer growthSeedToHitGoal}}</li>
    {{else}}
      <li>You could increase the number of customers you sign up each month to {{as-integer growthAmountToHitGoal}}</li>
